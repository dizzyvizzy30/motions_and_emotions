                <h2>Hi, it's me Ashay!</h2>
                <h3>I'm a photographer, coder, and licensed skydiver.</h3>
                <p>At my core, I'm driven by a deep curiosity for life and a desire to help others see the beauty in their own. My culture has taught me to find joy in the everyday, and that's a gift I bring to my work. I believe in living life to the fullest, and in sharing that passion through every lens and line of code.</p>
                <p>For me, photography is a fascinating blend of art and science. I'm captivated by the physics of light, the intricate mechanics of a camera, and the precision required to immortalize a fleeting moment. While the emotions a photograph evokes give it soul, the science is what truly gives it form and brings it to life.</p>
                <p>Beyond the lens, I'm a self-professed "nerdy coder," passionate about building my own ecosystems—from custom software solutions to streamlined creative workflows. This technical mindset empowers me to approach every project with innovation and a meticulous eye for detail. And when I'm not immersed in code or composing shots, you'll often find me in the kitchen, experimenting with new recipes and savoring the art of culinary creation.</p>

                <h2>My Ambition with Motions & Emotions</h2>
                <p>My ambition is to capture and convey the very essence of 'Motions & Emotions'. This relentless pursuit drives my journey, whether it’s through the lens of my camera, the logic of my code, or the thrill of my personal adventures. Skydiving, my biggest obsession, offers unparalleled freedom and breathtaking perspectives from thousands of feet up, constantly inspiring me to push creative and technical boundaries to tell compelling stories.</p>
                <p>This ambition extends deeply into developing bespoke photography tools and apps. I'm constantly experimenting with cutting-edge technology to enhance the art and science of visual storytelling. My goal is to create intuitive applications that capture dynamic scenes and tools that seamlessly blend the raw emotion of a moment with technical perfection, allowing for truly impactful narratives.</p>
                <p>Ultimately, my ambition is also to share this passion and knowledge, building a vibrant community around the craft. I'm actively creating insightful content—from tutorials on advanced photography techniques to deep dives into the science behind a perfect shot, and insights into developing your own innovative photography tools. Expect new apps, streamlined workflows, and engaging content, all designed to elevate our collective craft. This is my ambition: to inspire and be inspired by the beautiful interplay of motions and emotions.</p>
